Screener - 9/20
- use matPlot for graphs 
- found few open source stock data sources
^ need to figure out how implement these + manage cost
-- Quandyl - lower quality stock data base - https://www.quandl.com/tools/python
-- IQFeed - higher quality dBase, prefered, find out costs - http://www.iqfeed.net/
- found TA - LIb with stock indicator ?functions? - http://ta-lib.org/index.html
- What is "R" and CRAN? find out for "Quantmod" >> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/quantmod.pdf

- Py screener tutorial, using Yahoo - https://pythonprogramming.net/advanced-matplotlib-graphing-charting-tutorial/
- Coding Bat, Maps > maybe use for holding 
- CSV files is better way to store data
- Investor's underground?

9/21 
- R seems helpful, still need to know more but it is math and data oriented and made for graphs and stuff
- also, with R, can use Quantmod as a package with built in graphs and indicators 
- need R + an ide to start testing stuff
- need to figure out best way to go and to stick with it, too spread out rn

9/22
- Good API's on the Quandl website 
- Python, can use Pandas for data analysis
- Pandas is for CSV's and other computing
- Youtube playlist on data analysis and machine learning
- BAyes and SVM for machine learning

9/24 
- Using AI strategies to implement algorithms for the screener
- learning more about AI with youtube videos
